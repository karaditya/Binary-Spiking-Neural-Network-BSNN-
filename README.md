# Binary Spiking Neural Network (BSNN)

<h3 align="center">The Terabrain Project : simulating a billion spiking neurons on a Mac</h3>

Codes developped by Aditya Kar (PhD) and Jessim Ahdjoudj (Master 2) at the CerCo as part of the Terabrain Project. All rights reserved. 

The Terabrain Project is a novel approch to attempt a simulation with close to brainlike numbers of artificial neurons with a bio-inspired approch by the usage of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN).
